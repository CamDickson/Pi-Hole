<h1>Pi Hole - DNS Sink Hole </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Installed a DNS sinkhole for my home network using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and a software called “Pi-hole”, the software blocks ads, malware from my entire home network by filtering a blocklist over both IPv4 and IPv6. This was by far the coolest project I have done so far, the results are amazing! no more pesky ads everywhere you go online.
